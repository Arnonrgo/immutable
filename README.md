=========

This repository contains *generic* immutable collection types for Go. It includes
`List`, `Map`, `SortedMap`, `Set` and `SortedSet` implementations. Immutable collections can
provide efficient, lock free sharing of data by requiring that edits to the
collections return new collections.

The collection types in this library are meant to mimic Go built-in collections
such as`slice` and `map`. The primary usage difference between Go collections
and `immutable` collections is that `immutable` collections always return a new
collection on mutation so you will need to save the new reference.

This project is a fork of [github.com/benbjohnson/immutable](https://github.com/benbjohnson/immutable) with additional performance enhancements and builder APIs.

**Performance**: This library includes  batch builders that provide high accelaration for bulk operations (vs. discreet insert), with optimized memory usage 
and automatic batching. Regular operations maintain ~2x overhead compared to Go's 
built-in collections while providing thread-safe immutability.

Immutable collections are not for every situation, however, as they can incur
additional CPU and memory overhead. Please evaluate the cost/benefit for your
particular project.

Special thanks to the [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/)
team as the `List` & `Map` implementations are loose ports from that project.

Forked from https://github.com/benbjohnson/immutable with the following enhancements:

### **Performance Optimizations**

**Memory Architecture Improvements:**
- **Hybrid Data Structures**:
    - **List**: Uses a simple slice for small lists (< 32 elements) for up to 2x faster operations and ~85% less memory usage in common cases, transparently converting to a HAMT for larger sizes.
    - **Map**: Small-structure fast paths via builder initial flush and tiny array-node updates (â‰¤ 8 keys); core Map remains HAMT.
- **Pointer-Based Array Sharing (planned)**: Reduce allocations in `mapHashArrayNode.clone()` via pointer-backed children with copy-on-write
- **Lazy Copy-on-Write**: Arrays shared via pointers until actual modification, reducing memory overhead by 6-8%
- **Cache-Friendly Design**: Improved memory layout for better CPU cache utilization


## Concurrency with immutable collections

Immutable structures are snapshot-based: every mutation returns a new instance; the original remains unchanged. This makes concurrent reads safe without locks.

- Recommended pattern: a single writer goroutine owns the evolving collection and applies updates received via a channel. It then sends immutable snapshots to readers.
- Readers can safely use received snapshots without copying. Structural sharing ensures those snapshots are cheap to create and pass around.
- If you need a single, shared, evolving reference updated by multiple goroutines, synchronize the reference update (mutex or atomic CAS on a pointer). Without that, simultaneous `Enqueue`/`Dequeue` on the same snapshot may race logically (e.g., multiple consumers reading the same head, or lost enqueues).
- Builders are mutable conveniences and are not safe for concurrent use; keep them confined to one goroutine.

### **Batch Builders**

**Complete High-Performance Builder Suite:**
- **`BatchListBuilder`**: up 19x faster in tests (vs. discreet ops) bulk list construction with configurable batch sizes
- **`BatchMapBuilder`**: Measured gains on bulk construction; biggest wins for initial tiny batches and small structures
- **`BatchSetBuilder`** & **`BatchSortedSetBuilder`**: Efficient bulk set construction
- **`StreamingListBuilder`** & **`StreamingMapBuilder`**: Auto-flush with functional operations (filter, transform)
- **`SortedBatchBuilder`**: Optimized sorted map construction with optional sort maintenance

**Functional Programming Features:**
- Stream processing with automatic memory management
- Filter and transform operations for bulk data processing
- Configurable auto-flush thresholds for memory efficiency

### **Enhanced Testing & Validation**

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- Extensive benchmark suite measuring performance improvements
- Memory profiling and allocation analysis
- Race condition testing (`go test -race`) for thread safety validation
- Edge case and error condition testing for all new builders
- Large-scale performance validation (100-100K elements)


### **Architectural Enhancements**

**Thread Safety & Immutability:**
- Lock-free operations with atomic copying
- Structural sharing maintains thread safety
- Zero-overhead abstractions (Sets inherit Map optimizations)



## List

The `List` type represents a sorted, indexed collection of values and operates
similarly to a Go slice. It supports efficient append, prepend, update, and
slice operations.


### Adding list elements

Elements can be added to the end of the list with the `Append()` method or added
to the beginning of the list with the `Prepend()` method. Unlike Go slices,
prepending is as efficient as appending.

```go
// Create a list with 3 elements.
l := immutable.NewList[string]()
l = l.Append("foo")
l = l.Append("bar")
l = l.Prepend("baz")

fmt.Println(l.Len())  // 3
fmt.Println(l.Get(0)) // "baz"
fmt.Println(l.Get(1)) // "foo"
fmt.Println(l.Get(2)) // "bar"
```

Note that each change to the list results in a new list being created. These
lists are all snapshots at that point in time and cannot be changed so they
are safe to share between multiple goroutines.

### Updating list elements

You can also overwrite existing elements by using the `Set()` method. In the
following example, we'll update the third element in our list and return the
new list to a new variable. You can see that our old `l` variable retains a
snapshot of the original value.

```go
l := immutable.NewList[string]()
l = l.Append("foo")
l = l.Append("bar")
newList := l.Set(2, "baz")

fmt.Println(l.Get(1))       // "bar"
fmt.Println(newList.Get(1)) // "baz"
```

### Deriving sublists

You can create a sublist by using the `Slice()` method. This method works with
the same rules as subslicing a Go slice:

```go
l = l.Slice(0, 2)

fmt.Println(l.Len())  // 2
fmt.Println(l.Get(0)) // "baz"
fmt.Println(l.Get(1)) // "foo"
```

Please note that since `List` follows the same rules as slices, it will panic if
you try to `Get()`, `Set()`, or `Slice()` with indexes that are outside of
the range of the `List`.



### Searching list elements

You can check if a value exists in the list using `Contains()`. For comparable
types, equality uses `==`. For non-comparable types (e.g., `[]byte`), it falls
back to `reflect.DeepEqual`.

```go
// Basic usage
l := immutable.NewList[int]()
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ { l = l.Append(i) }

fmt.Println(l.Contains(3))  // true
fmt.Println(l.Contains(10)) // false

// Non-comparable example uses DeepEqual under the hood
b := immutable.NewList[[]byte]([]byte("foo"), []byte("bar"))
fmt.Println(b.Contains([]byte("foo"))) // true
```

For full control and best performance on custom types, use `ContainsFunc()` to
provide an equality function:

```go
type node struct{ v int }
l := immutable.NewList[*node](&node{v: 1}, &node{v: 2})

eq := func(a, b *node) bool { return a != nil && b != nil && a.v == b.v }
fmt.Println(l.ContainsFunc(&node{v: 2}, eq)) // true
fmt.Println(l.ContainsFunc(&node{v: 3}, eq)) // false
```

### Iterating lists

Iterators provide a clean, simple way to iterate over the elements of the list
in order. This is more efficient than simply calling `Get()` for each index.

Below is an example of iterating over all elements of our list from above:

```go
itr := l.Iterator()
for !itr.Done() {
	index, value, _ := itr.Next()
	fmt.Printf("Index %d equals %v\n", index, value)
}

// Index 0 equals baz
// Index 1 equals foo
```

By default iterators start from index zero, however, the `Seek()` method can be
used to jump to a given index.


### Efficiently building lists

If you are building large lists, it is significantly more efficient to use the
`ListBuilder`. It uses nearly the same API as `List` except that it updates
a list in-place until you are ready to use it. This can improve bulk list
building by 10x or more.

For even better performance with bulk operations (100+ elements), see the 
[Advanced Batch Builders](#advanced-batch-builders) section which provides up 
to 19x performance improvements.

```go
b := immutable.NewListBuilder[string]()
b.Append("foo")
b.Append("bar")
b.Set(2, "baz")

l := b.List()
fmt.Println(l.Get(0)) // "foo"
fmt.Println(l.Get(1)) // "baz"
```

Builders are invalid after the call to `List()`.


## Queue

An immutable FIFO queue with amortized O(1) Enqueue, Dequeue, and Peek, implemented using a two-list (Okasaki) representation. Internally it reuses `List[T]` for structural sharing and uses the slice fast-path for small sizes.

```go
q := immutable.NewQueue[int]()
q = q.Enqueue(1).Enqueue(2).Enqueue(3)

v, ok := q.Peek() // v=1, ok=true

q, v, ok = q.Dequeue() // v=1, ok=true
q, v, ok = q.Dequeue() // v=2, ok=true

itr := q.Iterator()
for !itr.Done() {
    idx, x, _ := itr.Next()
    _ = idx
    _ = x
}

// Builder
b := immutable.NewQueueBuilder[int]()
b.Enqueue(10)
b.EnqueueSlice([]int{20, 30})
finalQ := b.Queue()
```

Thread safety: operations return new queues; existing instances are never mutated, so concurrent reads are safe.

## Map

The `Map` represents an associative array that maps unique keys to values. It
is implemented to act similarly to the built-in Go `map` type. It is implemented
as a [Hash-Array Mapped Trie](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf).

Maps require a `Hasher` to hash keys and check for equality. There are built-in
hasher implementations for most primitive types such as `int`, `uint`, and
`string` keys. You may pass in a `nil` hasher to `NewMap()` if you are using
one of these key types.

### Setting map key/value pairs

You can add a key/value pair to the map by using the `Set()` method. It will
add the key if it does not exist or it will overwrite the value for the key if
it does exist.

Values may be fetched for a key using the `Get()` method. This method returns
the value as well as a flag indicating if the key existed. The flag is useful
to check if a `nil` value was set for a key versus a key did not exist.

```go
m := immutable.NewMap[string,int](nil)
m = m.Set("jane", 100)
m = m.Set("susy", 200)
m = m.Set("jane", 300) // overwrite

fmt.Println(m.Len())   // 2

v, ok := m.Get("jane")
fmt.Println(v, ok)     // 300 true

v, ok = m.Get("susy")
fmt.Println(v, ok)     // 200, true

v, ok = m.Get("john")
fmt.Println(v, ok)     // nil, false
```


### Removing map keys

Keys may be removed from the map by using the `Delete()` method. If the key does
not exist then the original map is returned instead of a new one.

```go
m := immutable.NewMap[string,int](nil)
m = m.Set("jane", 100)
m = m.Delete("jane")

fmt.Println(m.Len())   // 0

v, ok := m.Get("jane")
fmt.Println(v, ok)     // nil false
```


### Iterating maps

Maps are unsorted, however, iterators can be used to loop over all key/value
pairs in the collection. Unlike Go maps, iterators are deterministic when
iterating over key/value pairs.

```go
m := immutable.NewMap[string,int](nil)
m = m.Set("jane", 100)
m = m.Set("susy", 200)

itr := m.Iterator()
for !itr.Done() {
	k, v := itr.Next()
	fmt.Println(k, v)
}

// susy 200
// jane 100
```

Note that you should not rely on two maps with the same key/value pairs to
iterate in the same order. Ordering can be insertion order dependent when two
keys generate the same hash.


### Efficiently building maps

If you are executing multiple mutations on a map, it can be much more efficient
to use the `MapBuilder`. It uses nearly the same API as `Map` except that it
updates a map in-place until you are ready to use it.

For enhanced performance with bulk operations, see the 
[Advanced Batch Builders](#advanced-batch-builders) section which provides 
additional optimizations and functional programming capabilities.

```go
b := immutable.NewMapBuilder[string,int](nil)
b.Set("foo", 100)
b.Set("bar", 200)
b.Set("foo", 300)

m := b.Map()
fmt.Println(m.Get("foo")) // "300"
fmt.Println(m.Get("bar")) // "200"
```

Builders are invalid after the call to `Map()`.


### Implementing a custom Hasher

If you need to use a key type besides `int`, `uint`, or `string` then you'll
need to create a custom `Hasher` implementation and pass it to `NewMap()` on
creation.

Hashers are fairly simple. They only need to generate hashes for a given key
and check equality given two keys.

**Security Note:** A poorly implemented `Hasher` can result in frequent hash
collisions, which will degrade the `Map`'s performance from O(log n) to O(n),
making it vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks (a form of Denial of Service).
Ensure your `Hash` function provides a good distribution.

```go
type Hasher[K any] interface {
	Hash(key K) uint32
	Equal(a, b K) bool
}
```

Please see the internal `intHasher`, `uintHasher`, `stringHasher`, and
`byteSliceHasher` for examples.


## Sorted Map

The `SortedMap` represents an associative array that maps unique keys to values.
Unlike the `Map`, however, keys can be iterated over in-order. It is implemented
as a B+tree.

Sorted maps require a `Comparer` to sort keys and check for equality. There are
built-in comparer implementations for `int`, `uint`, and `string` keys. You may
pass a `nil` comparer to `NewSortedMap()` if you are using one of these key
types.

The API is identical to the `Map` implementation. The sorted map also has a
companion `SortedMapBuilder` for more efficiently building maps.


### Implementing a custom Comparer

If you need to use a key type besides `int`, `uint`, or `string` or derived types, then you'll
need to create a custom `Comparer` implementation and pass it to
`NewSortedMap()` on creation.

**Security Note:** A slow `Comparer` implementation can severely degrade the
performance of all `SortedMap` operations, making it vulnerable to Denial of Service
attacks. Ensure your `Compare` function is efficient.

Comparers on have one methodâ€”`Compare()`. It works the same as the
`strings.Compare()` function. It returns `-1` if `a` is less than `b`, returns
`1` if a is greater than `b`, and returns `0` if `a` is equal to `b`.

```go
type Comparer[K any] interface {
	Compare(a, b K) int
}
```

Please see the internal `defaultComparer` for an example, bearing in mind that it works for several types.

## Set

The `Set` represents a collection of unique values, and it is implemented as a
wrapper around a `Map[T, struct{}]`.

Like Maps, Sets require a `Hasher` to hash keys and check for equality. There are built-in
hasher implementations for most primitive types such as `int`, `uint`, and
`string` keys. You may pass in a `nil` hasher to `NewSet()` if you are using
one of these key types.


## Sorted Set

The `SortedSet` represents a sorted collection of unique values.
Unlike the `Set`, however, keys can be iterated over in-order. It is implemented
as a B+tree.

Sorted sets require a `Comparer` to sort values and check for equality. There are
built-in comparer implementations for `int`, `uint`, and `string` keys. You may
pass a `nil` comparer to `NewSortedSet()` if you are using one of these key
types.

The API is identical to the `Set` implementation.


## Advanced Batch Builders

For high-performance bulk operations, this library provides advanced batch builders
that can dramatically improve performance for large-scale data construction. These
builders use internal batching and mutable operations to minimize allocations and
provide up to **19x performance improvements** for bulk operations.

### Batch List Builder

The `BatchListBuilder` provides batched list construction with configurable batch
sizes for optimal performance:

```go
// Create a batch builder with batch size of 64
builder := immutable.NewBatchListBuilder[int](64)

// Add many elements efficiently
for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
    builder.Append(i)
}

// Or add slices efficiently
values := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
builder.AppendSlice(values)

list := builder.List() // 19x faster than individual Append() calls
```

**Performance**: Up to 19x faster than direct construction for large lists.

### Batch Map Builder

The `BatchMapBuilder` provides batched map construction with automatic flushing:

```go
// Create a batch map builder with batch size of 32
builder := immutable.NewBatchMapBuilder[string, int](nil, 32)

// Add many entries efficiently
for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
    builder.Set(fmt.Sprintf("key-%d", i), i)
}

// Or add from existing maps
entries := map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
builder.SetMap(entries)

m := builder.Map() // 8% faster + 5.8% less memory than regular builder
```

**Performance**: 8% faster with 5.8% memory reduction compared to regular builders.

### Streaming Builders

Streaming builders provide auto-flush capabilities and functional operations:

```go
// Streaming list builder with auto-flush at 1000 elements
builder := immutable.NewStreamingListBuilder[int](32, 1000)

// Functional operations
data := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

// Filter even numbers
builder.Filter(data, func(x int) bool { return x%2 == 0 })

// Transform by doubling
builder.Transform(data, func(x int) int { return x * 2 })

list := builder.List() // Contains processed elements
```

```go
// Streaming map builder with auto-flush and bulk operations
builder := immutable.NewStreamingMapBuilder[int, string](nil, 32, 500)

// Add individual entries (auto-flushes at 500 elements)
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    builder.Set(i, fmt.Sprintf("value-%d", i))
}

// Bulk operations with auto-flush
builder.SetMany(map[int]string{10: "ten", 20: "twenty", 30: "thirty"})

m := builder.Map()
```

### Batch Set Builders

Set builders provide efficient bulk set construction:

```go
// Batch set builder
builder := immutable.NewBatchSetBuilder[string](nil, 64)

values := []string{"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"} // "apple" duplicate
builder.AddSlice(values)

set := builder.Set() // Contains 3 unique values

// Sorted set builder with sort maintenance
sortedBuilder := immutable.NewBatchSortedSetBuilder[int](nil, 32, true)
numbers := []int{5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3}
sortedBuilder.AddSlice(numbers)

sortedSet := sortedBuilder.SortedSet() // Automatically sorted: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
```

### Sorted Batch Builder

For sorted maps, use `SortedBatchBuilder` with optional sort maintenance:

```go
// Maintain sort order in buffer for optimal insertion
builder := immutable.NewSortedBatchBuilder[int, string](nil, 32, true)

// Add in random order - automatically maintained in sorted buffer
builder.Set(3, "three")
builder.Set(1, "one")
builder.Set(2, "two")

sm := builder.SortedMap() // Efficiently constructed sorted map
```

### Performance Guidelines

**When to use batch builders:**
- Building collections with 100+ elements
- Bulk data import/export operations
- Processing large datasets
- When memory efficiency is critical

**Batch size recommendations:**
- **Small operations (< 1K elements)**: 16-32
- **Medium operations (1K-10K elements)**: 32-64  
- **Large operations (> 10K elements)**: 64-128
- **Memory-constrained environments**: 16-32

**Performance improvements:**
- **List construction**: Up to 19x faster for bulk operations
- **Map construction**: 8% faster with 5.8% memory reduction
- **Set construction**: Inherits map performance benefits
- **Streaming operations**: Automatic memory management with functional programming

### What's New (2025-09)

- zero dependencies
- Small-structure fast paths:
  - List: Batch flush extends slice-backed lists in a single allocation
  - Map: Empty-map batch flush builds an array node in one shot (last-write-wins); tiny array-node updates applied in-place when under threshold
- New builder APIs:
  - `(*BatchListBuilder).Reset()` and `(*BatchMapBuilder).Reset()` for builder reuse without reallocations
- Concurrency:
  - Added concurrent read benchmarks and mixed read/write benchmarks (immutable Map vs `sync.Map`)
  - Added concurrency correctness tests (copy-on-write isolation under concurrent readers)

### Current Performance Snapshot

- Map Get (10K): immutable ~14.5 ns/op (0 allocs); builtin map ~6.8 ns/op; `sync.Map` Load ~20.3 ns/op
- Map RandomSet (10K): ~595â€“687 ns/op, 1421 B/op, 7 allocs/op (after tuning)
- Concurrent reads (ns/op, lower is better):
  - 1G: immutable 3.53 vs `sync.Map` 6.03
  - 4G: immutable 2.31 vs `sync.Map` 3.21
  - 16G: immutable 2.39 vs `sync.Map` 3.24
- Mixed read/write (ns/op):
  - 90/10 (9R/1W): immutable 26.0 vs `sync.Map` 38.4
  - 70/30 (7R/3W): immutable 24.6 vs `sync.Map` 65.0
  - 50/50 (5R/5W): immutable 27.3 vs `sync.Map` 47.4

### New APIs (Builders)

```go
// Reuse list builder across batches without reallocations
lb := immutable.NewBatchListBuilder[int](64)
// ... append/flush ...
lb.Reset() // clears state, keeps capacity

// Reuse map builder and retain hasher
mb := immutable.NewBatchMapBuilder[string,int](nil, 64)
// ... set/flush ...
mb.Reset() // clears state, preserves hasher & buffer capacity
```

### Benchmarking & Profiling

- Run all benchmarks with allocations:
```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=3 ./...
```

- Profile a representative write-heavy benchmark:
```bash
# CPU and memory profiles (example: Map RandomSet, size=10K)
go test -bench=BenchmarkMap_RandomSet/size-10000 -benchmem -run="^$" \
  -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof -count=1

# Inspect hotspots
go tool pprof -top cpu.prof
go tool pprof -top -sample_index=alloc_space mem.prof
```

Optional: Enable PGO locally
```bash
# Generate a profile and write default.pgo
go test -bench=. -run="^$" -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -count=1
go tool pprof -proto cpu.prof > cpu.pb.gz
go tool pgo -compile=local -o default.pgo cpu.pb.gz

# Use the profile for builds/tests (Go 1.21+)
go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=3 -pgo=auto ./...
```

- Compare immutable vs `sync.Map` concurrent reads:
```bash
go test -bench=BenchmarkConcurrentReads -benchmem -run="^$" -count=1
```

- Mixed workload (reads/writes):
```bash
go test -bench=BenchmarkConcurrentMixed -benchmem -run="^$" -count=1
```
